## 🔐 API Key Setup

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API.

To make it work:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up (if you haven’t already).
2. Get your **free API key**.
3. In the `index.html` file, find the following line in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

4. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key:

```javascript
const apiKey = 'your-real-api-key';
